# My Portfolio


Hey there! This is my GitHub portfolio where I've gathered some of the projects I've worked on during my master degree in "[Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge)" at the Alma Mater University of Bologna. These projects span a wide range of topics and applications, reflecting my journey in this field. From data analyses to interactive web tools, I hope you find something interesting here. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or collaborate. Thanks for checking it out!



This repository contains all the projects developed so far for my master degree in "[Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge)" at the Alma Mater University of Bologna.

Vitali|Project Requirements: The overall purpose of MMMM is to create a system that organizes content into publications that are: <br>– nicely presented according to easily switchable typographic themes <br> – georeferenced and shown on a map <br> – enriched with a rich supply of metadata and additional services. 
<br> The editorial board chooses 1, 2, or 3 topics (depending on the size of the group), and 3 texts (long or very long) on each topic, converts them into HTML, places interesting metadata in the content, and displays them with interesting connections between the articles and a map. All typographic details, such as font family, sizes, colors, margins, aspect ratios, page sizes, images, captions, etc. are designed to exactly reflect a graphic theme. Thus, the texts take the form and the feeling of a real serial publication, and stylistic and organizational similarities are really perceivable. <br> The typographic styles I have personally curated are those inspired by **Art Nouveau (Emporium Magazine)** and  **Post Modernism (Apriel German)>** [View repository](https://github.com/giorgimariachiara/TheLivesOf)
